      I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack
      development (.NET and Angular). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the
      technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience,
      pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code
      matters to me.

      I began my journey as a web developer in 2019, and since then, I've
      continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and
      learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties,
      6 years after starting my web development journey, I'm building
      cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js,
      TypeScript, Angular, Tailwindcss, Angular material and much more.

      When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on
      twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or
      enjoying some free time. You can follow me on GitHub.
